Listing 3.5?VHDL Code for Behavioral Description of D-Latch Using Signal-Assignment Statements
      
       entity Dltch_sig is
       port (d, E : in bit; Q : buffer bit; Qb : out bit);
       --Q is declared as a buffer because it is an input/output 
       --signal; it appears on both the left and right
       -- hand sides of assignment
       --statements.
       end Dltch_sig;
       architecture DL_sig of Dltch_sig is
       begin
       process (d, E)
       begin
           if E = '1' then
               Q <= d;      -- signal assignment
               Qb <= not Q; -- signal assignment
           end if;
