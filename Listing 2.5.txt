Listing 2.5?HDL Code for a D-Latch—VHDL and Verilog
      
      VHDL D-Latch Description
       library IEEE;
       use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
       
       entity D_Latch is
       port (D, E : in std_logic;
           Q, Qbar : buffer std_logic);
       -- Q and Qbar are declared as buffer because they act as 
       --both input and output, they appear on the right and left 
       --hand side of signal assignment statements. inout or
       --  linkage could have been used instead of buffer.
       end D_Latch;
       
       architecture DL_DtFl of D_Latch is
       constant Delay_EorD : Time := 9 ns;
       constant Delay_inv : Time := 1 ns;
       begin
       --Assume 9-ns propagation delay time between 
       --E or D and Qbar; and 1 ns between Qbar and Q.
       
       Qbar <= (D and E) nor (not E and Q) after Delay_EorD;
       Q <= not Qbar after Delay_inv;
       end DL_DtFl;
      
      Verilog D-Latch Description
       module D_latch (D, E, Q, Qbar);
       input D, E;
       output Q, Qbar;
       
       /* Verilog treats the ports as internal ports,
       so Q and Qbar are not considered here as
       both input and output. If the port is
       connected externally as bidirectional,
       then we should use inout. */
       
       time Delay_EorD = 9;
       time Delay_inv = 1;
       assign #Delay_EorD Qbar = ~((E & D) |
           (~E & Q));
       assign #Delay_inv Q = ~ Qbar;
